These data are read counts generated by kallisto mapping using different settings and post-processing. The assessment was performed on one metagenome sample.

abund_GCA.tsv:        Reads mapping to multi-fasta of genes in paired kallisto setting
Sample_77304_CDS.txt: Reads mapping to genome in paired kallisto setting; extracted with bedtools
TAD_CDS_77304.txt:    Read counts after post processing to quantify truncated average sequence depth (TAD80)
MARINO_kalu.tsv:      Reads mapping to multi-fasta of genes in unpaired paired kallisto setting
